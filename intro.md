# Welcome to Squizz!
## What is Squizz?

**Squizz** is a platform designed to facilitate dialogue around the topic of mining in Europe. **Squizz** is a spatial tool that can help the users to identify potential Environmental, Social and Governance aspects that would require attention if a mining site would be envisaged in a given region. Specifically, it enables the visualization of potential positive and/or negative impacts of mining in a regional socio-economic and environmental context.  

Squizz is thus a tool dedicated to enable informed dialogues and critical thinking that might lead to  the co-creation of sustainable strategies for the metal sourcing required to ensure the energy transition in Europe. The targeted audience is primarily stakeholders from **research, industry, and local government**.

## What does Squizz do?

Squizz uses data science tools to combine freely available social, governance and environmental data in the EU that are available as maps. Based on empirical processes, that still need scrutiny, the tool then identifies potential impacts of mine sites on economic, environmental, social factors that were identified as important when addressing potential mining projects. To ease the access to non-experts, the result is a semi-quantitative indication of potential opportunities or conflicts – which are referred to as **impact tendencies**:

- **Positive tendencies** suggest potential benefits (e.g., jobs, regional development). 
- **Negative tendencies** suggest possible risks or tensions (e.g., negative environmental impact, social resistance).

The impact tendency values are colour-coded on a map of Europe that the user can interactively manipulate. 

## Disclaimer

The VECTOR project [aims](https://vectorproject.eu/) to understand societal responses to critical raw material exploration within the EU, integrating environmental concerns with scientific solutions for sustainable metal sourcing. While acknowledging mining’s potential environmental and societal damage, the project emphasizes the need for responsible metal sourcing to meet climate goals, alongside reduced consumption and circular economy technologies.  Squizz is meant to support dialogue during early-stage processes such as stakeholder engagement or regional exploration or screening, by highlighting social and environmental considerations. This tool is therefore not intended to make predictions. Real-world impacts depend on specific project characteristics, community engagement, mitigation strategies, etc. 

We kindly ask you to acknowledge that Squizz doesn’t take a stance on any specific mines, past or proposed. It doesn’t label regions as “good” or “bad” for mining. It doesn’t predict whether any stakeholder would approve a project or not. Squizz is simply a research prototype that needs considerate caution.
