# Welcome to Squizz!

Squizz is a prototype application that gathers social and environmental data across the EU, and combines them to help explore mining's potential impacts.

Although hugely challenging, identifying regions where mining can help co-create mutual benefits to society, business and the environment is crucial to ensure sustainable and geopolitically secure supply of the critical raw materials we all depend on. Squizz thus aims to help explore the social and environmental context that (partially) determines a mines impact. It combines these contextual data with information on a hypothetical new mining operation to derive **impact tendencies** - semi-quantitative (and uncertain) indications of the potential opportunites or conflicts that could result from mining-induced environmental and societal changes. 

Positive impact tendencies suggest possible mining-related opportunities, while negative tendencies indicate mining-related conflicts or challenges. Note that these are **not** predictions of impact: actual impacts depend hugely on specific details (and engagement or mitigation strategies), so cannot be generically predicted. Rather, impact tendency aims to identify and map likely factors that should be considered during e.g., early stage minerals exploration or permitting. 

Finally, the value derived from a mine will depend on the priorities of the person (you), community or company for which that value is meaningful. Hence, Squizz also aggregates the impact-tendencies indicated for each considered environmental and social factor into a composite **ESGi** index. This aims to balance the inevitable trade-offs based on your chosen values, and so indicate areas where mining might be worthwhile (or not).

Before continuing, please confirm that you are aware that Squizz:

1. Does not advocate for or against any specific (current or proposed) mines.
2. Does not identify regions as being "appropriate" or "inappropriate" for mining.
3. Does not predict mining "acceptability" or "social licence".
4. Is a research prototype, so should be treated with skepticism.
