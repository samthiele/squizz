# Welcome to Squizz!

## What is Squizz?

Imagine a map of Europe, and think how a mine would change the environment or bring jobs to different regions. With **Squizz** you can see how different mine types can affect relevant factors, such as local employment or forests, and how this might influence the well-being of citizens. 

And guess what? You can make these different impacts more or less important, by playing with the cursors to personalize your findings! In doing so, Squizz aims to support well-informed discussions and thoughtful planning, which can lead to the development of sustainable strategies for finding the metals needed for Europe's transition to clean energy. It is mainly intended for people involved in **research, industry, and local government**.

Squizz uses advanced data science tools to gather and combine open-source social, economical, and environmental information from across the EU, all presented on maps. By combining this data, Squizz tries to highlight the most important positive and negative aspects that will need careful attention and dialogue among all stakeholders. To make this information easy to understand, Squizz provides a simple rating system that shows potential benefits or issues:

**Positive Ratings**: These indicate possible advantages, like new jobs or regional development.
**Negative Ratings**: These point out potential problems, such as environmental damage or housing pressures.

These ratings are shown on an interactive map of Europe, using colors to make the information clear and easy to explore. 

## DISCLAIMER

Squizz is designed to help with early discussions, like involving different groups or exploring regions, by showing social and environmental factors to consider. It's not meant to make predictions. The actual impact of a mining project depends on many things, like the specific details of the project, community involvement, and strategies to reduce harm.

Please note that Squizz doesn't support or oppose any specific mines, past or proposed. It doesn't label regions as good or bad for mining, and it doesn't predict whether anyone would approve a project. Squizz is just a research tool that should be used with caution.

Squizz was developed by the [VECTOR](https://vectorproject.eu/) project, which aims to better understand societal responses to exploration for critical raw materials within the EU, and integrate these views and concerns with scientific solutions to develop strategies that can be used to enable sustainable, responsible exploration for critical raw materials within the EU. The VECTOR project is all about understanding how people feel about finding important raw materials within the EU. It combines concerns for the environment with scientific methods to find metals in a sustainable and societally acceptible way. While mining can have negative effects on the environment and society, the project highlights the importance of responsible metal sourcing to achieve climate goals, alongside reducing consumption and promoting recycling technologies.
